### Scheduling Python scripts with GitHub Actions

In this scripts, I scheduled the deletion of infatructures from a cloud provider(Azure).

This can be very useful for labs and practice use cases, incase I forget to delete anything after a practice or lab. 

That way I do not incure added on costs on my credit :).
